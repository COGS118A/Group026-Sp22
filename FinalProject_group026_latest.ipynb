The dataset we will be using is adapted from the Stanford Dogs Dataset, which has a total of 20,580 individual dog images of 120 different breed categories. We plan on using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for the image classification task. Before feeding input images into the neural nets, we will explore image transformation methods (e.g., image cropping/ resizing, converting to greyscale) to ensure the maximal performance of the CNN with the least amount of information required. The performance of models will be measured using the two metrics for classification: Accuracy and Area Under Curve (AUC). Lastly, we will apply data visualization tools such as TSNE to the classification results, which helps visualize the separability of the clusters of dog breeds."
